# QuantitativeRiskSim
Quantitative risk simulation tools

This a pure python (2.7) code up of the quantitative risk simulation method presented by Douglas Hubbard in his book, "How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk"

http://www.howtomeasureanything.com/cybersecurity/

See the "HomeComputerLossSim.py" example file for usage.

This is intended to run from a full Anaconda Python-based Data Science Platform

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

It relies on several tools that are standard in that distribution.

Good luck!
