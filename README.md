# QuantitativeRiskSim
Quantitative risk simulation tools

This a pure python (2.7) code up of the quantitative risk simulation method presented by Douglas Hubbard in his book, "How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk"

http://www.howtomeasureanything.com/cybersecurity/

See the "HomeComputerLossSim.py" example file for usage of my original code.

See "HomeComputerLossSim2.py" and "decomposedRiskTest.py" for my improved risk definition classes.

See claimsrisk.py for a complete single risk usage example, explained in my BSidesLV 2018 talk at [TBD].

Sample Risk Decomposition.xlsx shows all of the cost centers I considered, and MPIManpowerPools.py plus MPI_OtherCosts.py is where I coded them up.  

This is intended to run from a full Anaconda Python-based Data Science Platform

It relies on several tools that are standard in that distribution.

Good luck!
